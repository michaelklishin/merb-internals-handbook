== Start.

There are couple of open source Merb book attempts but they all explain
how to use Merb. As occasional Merb contributor I always wanted a book that
really saves my time when it comes to understanding how things work inside
of the framework. So I decided to write this little book about Merb internals.

== Foreword.

* Hacker's framework needs hacker's handbook.
	 
== What happens when you run merb executable.

* Start.
* Arguments parsing.
* Server start.
* Framework boot.

== Then request comes in.

* Merb on Rack.
* Rackup.
* Dispatch.
* Template inlining.
* Router internals.
* MIME formats and what's behind "provides API".
* Rendering in Merb.
* Sessions.
* Plugins.

== Plugins architecture.
	 
** ORM plugins.
** Slices.
** Other plugins.

== Development.

* Overview.
* Public and private specs.
* Repository organization.


== Foreword

Knowing how tools you use work under the covers is a huge win for every
developer out there and Merb is small and clean enough for everyone to
understand it in short period of time. You can learn a lot about HTTP,
web frameworks design and even hidden gems of Ruby web servers
(how many of you know that Thin can actually serve requests in
threads and not block the event loop?).
