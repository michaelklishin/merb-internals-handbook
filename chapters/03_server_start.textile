h1. Overview of this chapter

What you are going to learn in this chapter:

* How Merb bootstraps itself.
* How daemonization works.
* How Merb manages pid files.
* How Merb is started and stopped.
* How Merb reacts to signals sent to it.

This chapter is about framework plumbing, really low level things.
It heavily intersects with certain parts of the next chapter.
You can think of it as two phases of boot: this chapter describes
early stage (bootstrap) and second one describes later stage
(bootloaders run).

If you are not interested in all the gory details of framework/server
operation, feel free to skip this chapter. Make sure you look through
next one in any case though: some details in the next chapter are
not directly related to boot and may help a lot in understanding of Merb,
yet are simple enough even for beginners.

h1. Diving in

So, command line options (or programmatically passed options) are
parsed at this point and Merb is ready to start boot process.
Right after that Merb does basically 3 things:


* Merb.environment and Merb.root are initialized from Merb configuration.
* Merb checks action you give it in arguments (kill, forced kill, fast redeploy, etc).
* Merb does early stage work of managing pid files, process privilegies and daemonization.

To find all the details, we need to start at Merb.start
method. It can be found in merb-core/lib/merb-core.rb.

On server start Merb has to figure out whether other instance
is already bound to given port(s), so
it calculates pid file path, reads it and checks the process if it's alive.

If not, Merb runs bootloader and starts Rack adapter. This pid file requirement
means that if you set Merb port, daemonization options or pid file
location in init file of your application, it would have no effect
on application start because init file is loaded later in the
process. So you must specify port, daemonization option and pid file
location from command line or in the startup script you may use
instead of default merb executable.

Note that during this early stage logger is bound to stdout so
even though logger is not really initialized at this point,
you can see some output.

You can have a look at implementation of startup code in
Merb::Server.start (merb-core/lib/merb-core/server.rb).

Most of methods used in server.rb are simple. The most tricky thing
is probably how daemonization works.
Merb forks off and child process places itself into a new group,
becoming a group leader thus detaches from tty.
Then child process reopens streams: stdin and stdout to /dev/null,
stderr to stdout, and starts trapping TERM signal.
Original process exits.

A couple of notes: child process chdirs to wherever Merb.root
points to, pid file is removed on exit.

Details can be found in Merb::Server#daemonize (merb-core/lib/merb-core/server.rb).

To finish this pid files story, here's how Merb figures out if
the process specified in found pid file is alive:

* Find out pid file location.
* Read process id from it.
* Send signal 0 to that pid and see how it works out.

In both daemon and foreground run scenarios, boot is started next
by calling Merb::Server.bootup:

* Shutdown on SIGTERM signal.
* Run bootloaders.
* Start Rack adapter.

Details are in Merb::Server.bootup (merb-core/lib/merb-core/server.rb).

Bootloader loads and initializes the framework, application code and does
things like template inlining (don't worry if you do not know what
it means, it's explained later in the handbook).

Since boot process involves several steps and is important part of
the framework operation, it takes the whole next chapter.


Now let's look at how pid file is stored and removed. It's simple.
When we store process id to the file (so other programs can
figure out what Merb process id for certain port is), we
follow simple convention:

* Pid file contains one integer: current process id.
* Pid file is stored to the same directory as logs.
* Pid file is named as "merb.N.pid" where N is port number.
* Master process (more about it in the next chapter) is named as "merb.master.pid".

Code for this step can be found in
Merb::Server.store_details (merb-core/lib/merb-core/server.rb)
while aforementioned naming scheme implementation is in
Merb::Server.pid_file (merb-core/lib/merb-core/server.rb)

* Merb calculates path to pid file using port it bound to and
  simple conventions.
* If pid file exists, it's removed from the file system.

Latter step is implementd in Merb::Server#remove_pid_file.

h2. Killing time

<blockquote>
The silence is over, they attack again
Killing and hatred drive me insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back
</blockquote>

(Sweet Savage "Killing time")

So far, so good. But what if you ask merb to stop running instances?
How violent merb gets?

It turns out not very. Here is how it works in the nutshell:

* Figure out signal to use from the passed action.
* SIGINT  is used for graceful stop.
* SIGKILL is used for forced stop.
* Read pids from pid files, send signal to the process with id in it.

Details are in Merb::Server.kill_pid (merb-core/lib/merb-core/server.rb).

Some gory details: Ruby can use signal names or numbers. Merb converts numbers
into names using mapping returned by Signal.list. Before pid file paths
are calculated, framework layout should be initialized so here we get ahead of
ourselves a bit and see one of Merb's bootloaders mentioned: BuildFramework
bootloader. It just sets paths layout: where config dir is, where logs dir is,
et cetera.

You also can see master process mentioned, it is explained in details in
the next chapter.

To stop process with given pid file, Merb::Server.kill_pid is used.
It takes signal to use nd pid file path, and does the following:

* Reads pid.
* Uses Process.kill to send signal to the pid.
* Removes pid file.
* Handles possible exceptions and logs meaninful messages.

You can find code in Merb::Server.kill_pid (merb-core/lib/merb-core/server.rb)
