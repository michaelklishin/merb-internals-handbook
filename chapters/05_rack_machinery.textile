h1. Rack machinery in Merb.

Once bootloaders are all run, Merb starts Rack adapter and requests can be
served from this very moment. Now it's time to have a look how Merb uses Rack
under the covers to greatly simplify support for variety of pluggable
middleware, web servers and multiple application layouts.


h2. What is Rack?

Rack README states that Rack is "a modular Ruby web server interface". Some say
Rack is a Ruby webserver abstraction. It's heavily inspired by Python's WSGI
(Web Server Gateway Interface) which is a
"standard":http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/ in Python world.


h2. What? Web server interface?

The rationale of WSGI can be summarized to one sentence from PEP333:

"This wide variety of choices can be a problem for new Python users, because
generally speaking, their choice of web framework will limit their choice of
usable web servers, and vice versa.".

In a post-Rails world there is a dozen of Ruby web frameworks and until Rack was
created by Christian Neukirchen they all were doing duplicate work on web
servers support and common operations. If your deployment environment runs web server X, you only could use
frameworks that support X, and no others. Rack gives frameworks and web servers
developers universal unified interface.


h2. Get yourself familiar with roots.

I'd highly recomment reading "original WSGI
PEP":http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333 before you continue reading this
chapter.


h2. Rack applications.

Framework side of specification is implemented by Rack applications. Rack
application is any callable object (that responds to :call message) that takes
Rack environment and returns an array of three elements:

 * response status string
 * hash of response headers
 * response body object

Response object *must* respond to each, so in Ruby 1.8 string is a valid
response object and nil is not. This simple requirement means you can return an
IO object that will stream data to the client.

Rack environment is a hash of CGI-like headers. You can find details in
"Rack specification":http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/files/SPEC.html.


h2. Middleware.

In the middle, after client is connected to the server but before framework
starts serving it there maybe be any number of components called "middleware".
Merb comes with middleware for serving static files (good for development, in
production, of course, consider using nginx or something similar), profiling and
path prefixes handling.

Middleware wraps a Rack application, does some work (profiles, sends notifications,
tries to serve certain files without triggering the framework, etc) and calls the
application if necessary. You can think of Rack middleware as of highly reusable
filters that run outside of framework dispatch process.

Frameworks like Django and Pylons use middleware for all sorts of stuff, from
conditional get support to csrf attacks protecttion to session setup and finalization.


h2. Adapters.

Rack adapters connect web server intefaces with Merb Rack application that takes
the environment and passes it to Merb dispatcher. Since different web servers
have different APIs, Merb comes with a bunch of adapters: for Mongrel, Thin,
Ebb, Thin with Thin-Turbo backend, Evented Mongrel, Swiftiplied Mongrel, FastCGI, CGI, Webrick.

Adapter's responsibility is to start the web server using Merb application configuration
(port, host, process user and group, etc) and call Merb Rack application when request
comes in.

Here is what Thin adapter looks like:

require "thin"

module Merb
  module Rack
    class Thin
      # start a Thin server on given host and port.

      # ==== Parameters
      # opts<Hash>:: Options for Thin (see below).
      #
      # ==== Options (opts)
      # :host<String>:: The hostname that Thin should serve.
      # :port<Fixnum>:: The port Thin should bind to.
      # :socket<Fixnum>>:: The socket number that thin should bind to.
      # :socket_file<String>>:: The socket file that thin should attach to.
      # :app<String>>:: The application name.
      def self.start(opts={})
        Merb::Dispatcher.use_mutex = false
        if opts[:socket] || opts[:socket_file]
          socket = opts[:socket] || "0"
          socket_file = opts[:socket_file] || "#{Merb.root}/log/merb.#{socket}.sock"
          Merb.logger.warn!("Using Thin adapter with socket file #{socket_file}.")
          server = ::Thin::Server.new(socket_file, opts[:app], opts)
        else
          Merb.logger.warn!("Using Thin adapter on host #{opts[:host]} and port #{opts[:port]}.")
          if opts[:host].include?('/')
            opts[:host] = "#{opts[:host]}-#{opts[:port]}"
          end
          server = ::Thin::Server.new(opts[:host], opts[:port].to_i, opts[:app], opts)
        end
        Merb::Server.change_privilege
        ::Thin::Logging.silent = true
        server.start
      end
    end
  end
end

What this does is starts Thin using host/port or socket and passes it an instance of Merb Rack application
that knows how to pass incoming requests to Merb dispatcher. Pretty simple.

Here is Merb Rack application I referred to a number of times already:

module Merb  
  module Rack
    class Application
      def call(env) 
        begin
          controller = ::Merb::Dispatcher.handle(Merb::Request.new(env))
        rescue Object => e
          return [500, {Merb::Const::CONTENT_TYPE => "text/html"}, e.message + "<br/>" + e.backtrace.join("<br/>")]
        end
        Merb.logger.info "\n\n"
        Merb.logger.flush

        unless controller.headers[Merb::Const::DATE]
          require "time"
          controller.headers[Merb::Const::DATE] = Time.now.rfc2822.to_s
        end
        controller.rack_response
      end

      def deferred?(env)
        path = env[Merb::Const::PATH_INFO] ? env[Merb::Const::PATH_INFO].chomp('/') : ""
        if path =~ Merb.deferred_actions
          Merb.logger.info! "Deferring Request: #{path}"
          true
        else
          false
        end        
      end # deferred?(env)
    end # Application
  end # Rack
end # Merb

It has one addition over vanilla Rack application: deferred? method. This is used by event-driven servers
(currently Thin and Ebb) to figure out that request should be deferred (run in a thread) instead of running
it in main reactor loop. This allows event-driven servers handle long requests without blocking the event loop.

Short cut from Thin::Connection source code:

# +true+ if <tt>app.call</tt> will be called inside a thread.
# You can set all requests as threaded setting <tt>Connection#threaded=true</tt>
# or on a per-request case returning +true+ in <tt>app.deferred?</tt>.
def threaded?
  @threaded || (@app.respond_to?(:deferred?) && @app.deferred?(@request.env))
end


	 
h2. Rackup.

Rack has it's "own init" file often referred to as "rackup file". Conventional
extension of this file is .ru, though you may use .rb or anything else, as long
as it is a valid Ruby code.

Rackup file maps URLs to middleware and applications, and constructed using
special DSL implemented within a Rack::Builder class.

Rack source code provides the following example of using Rack::Builder:

app = Rack::Builder.new {
  use Rack::CommonLogger
  use Rack::ShowExceptions
  map "/lobster" do
    use Rack::Lint
    run Rack::Lobster.new
  end
}

It stacks two middleware components, Rack::CommonLogger and Rack::ShowExceptions,
and maps URL /lobster to Rack::Lobster application (that shows and
rotates lobster image).




h1. Rack middleware examples.

Rack middleware in Rack source repository is very much like Mongrel handlers
but with unified application interface. You can use them as examples or in some
certain situations in production applications.

h2. Rack::URLMap.

Rack::URLMap is an application from Rack suite that maps paths
relative to the root of the server to application instances.
When environment is passed in, paths are checked
and application with longest matching path is called.

h2. Rack::Deflater

Rack::Deflater compresses body of the response. It runs after framework finished
processing the request.

h2. Merb::Rack::ConditionalGet

A rip off of Django's conditional get WSGI middleware.


h1. How Merb does the rackup.

Remember Rackup bootloader from previous chapter? It looks like this:

Merb::BootLoader::RackUpApplication (merb-core/lib/bootloader.rb):
<pre>
class Merb::BootLoader::RackUpApplication < Merb::BootLoader
  # Setup the Merb Rack App or read a rackup file located at
  # Merb::Config[:rackup] with the same syntax as the
  # rackup tool that comes with rack. Automatically evals the file in
  # the context of a Rack::Builder.new { } block. Allows for mounting
  # additional apps or middleware.
  def self.run
    require 'rack'
    if File.exists?(Merb.dir_for(:config) / "rack.rb")
      Merb::Config[:rackup] ||= Merb.dir_for(:config) / "rack.rb"
    end

    if Merb::Config[:rackup]
      rackup_code = File.read(Merb::Config[:rackup])
      Merb::Config[:app] = eval("::Rack::Builder.new {( #{rackup_code}\n )}.to_app", TOPLEVEL_BINDING, Merb::Config[:rackup])
    else
      Merb::Config[:app] = ::Rack::Builder.new {
         if prefix = ::Merb::Config[:path_prefix]
           use Merb::Rack::PathPrefix, prefix
         end
         use Merb::Rack::Static, Merb.dir_for(:public)
         run Merb::Rack::Application.new
       }.to_app
    end
  end
end
</pre>

What it does is setting up Rack applications stack web server is going to use.
Merb Rack application instance is stored in Merb::Config[:app].
When bootloader is done, web server adapter is started: it listens to host and
port, processes requests using middleware stack that end up calling
Merb Rack application stored in Merb::Config[:app].

API of web server adapters for Merb are actually very simple: they should have
a class method start that takes a Hash of options. Options may vary from web
server to web server but one of them is :app option: again, this is Merb Rack
application.

Default middleware stack Merb uses includes path prefix and static files middleware.
